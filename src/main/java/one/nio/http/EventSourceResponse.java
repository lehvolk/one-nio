/**
 * A Response, which can poll for server emitted events.
 * Unlike regular {@link Response} this object must be close'd to
 * prevent resource leak.
 * <p>
 * The usage flow is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Call {@link HttpClient#openEvents(Request, int)}</li>
 * <li>Inspect the result code, if it is not OK process the error</li>
 * <li>Inspect the content-type, it must be text/event-stream; if it is not - process the response body - there will be no events</li>
 * <li>while ( ( event = poll() ) != null ) process( event )</li>
 * <li>call {@link #close()}</li>
 * <li>call {@link HttpClient#reopenEvents(Request, String, int)} with last processed {@link Event#id()} and go to p.2</li>
 * </ol>
